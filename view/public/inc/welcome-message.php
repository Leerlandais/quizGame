    <p>You have 3 lives &lpar;That is to say, you can get three questions wrong or pass three times&rpar;</p>
    <p>You are marked +1 for a correct answer, -1 for a pass and -2 for a wrong answer</p>
    <p>A multiplier is applied to difficulty. Easy = 1, Medium = 1.5, Hard = 2</p>
    <p>A speed bonus will be applied once I figure that bit out</p>
    <p>Multipliers are not taken into account for wrongly answered or passed questions</p>
    <p>If you want to try for the top 10, you'll need to <a href="?loginUser">log in</a> or <a href="?createUser">create</a> an account first</p>
